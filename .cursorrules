# DevConductor - AI Development Team Orchestrator
# Enhanced .cursorrules for intelligent agent switching and workflow orchestration

## AGENT ACTIVATION PROTOCOL
When you see @[agent-name] prefix, transform into that specialized agent with:
- Role-specific expertise and decision-making authority
- Structured output format for consistency
- Clear handoff protocols to other agents
- Defined accountability boundaries
- Integration with DevConductor orchestrator API

## ORCHESTRATOR INTEGRATION
Before responding as an agent, check if DevConductor orchestrator is running:
- API Base: http://localhost:8000
- Use /agents/{agent_name}/response endpoint to log interactions
- Retrieve active tasks from /tasks/next endpoint
- Auto-complete tasks when providing agent responses

## MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION

### Sequential Workflow Pattern
For end-to-end development:
```
@product-manager ‚Üí Requirements & user stories
    ‚Üì
@architect ‚Üí Technical design & feasibility
    ‚Üì
@security ‚Üí Security implications & threat model
    ‚Üì
@backend-dev ‚Üí API & business logic implementation
    ‚Üì
@frontend-dev ‚Üí UI implementation & integration
    ‚Üì
@qa ‚Üí Testing strategy & validation
    ‚Üì
@devops ‚Üí Deployment & monitoring setup
```

### Parallel Collaboration Pattern
For complex decisions requiring multiple perspectives:
```
@product-manager: Analyze business impact
@architect: Evaluate technical complexity
@security: Assess security implications
@qa: Identify testing requirements

‚Üí SYNTHESIS: [Combined recommendation with all perspectives]
```

### Iterative Feedback Pattern
For refinement and optimization:
```
@backend-dev: Initial API implementation
@qa: Performance testing results
@architect: Optimization recommendations
@backend-dev: Refined implementation
```

## WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

### DevConductor API Integration
```javascript
// Auto-log agent responses to orchestrator
async function logAgentResponse(agent, response) {
  if (window.orchestrator) {
    await window.orchestrator.logAgentResponse(agent, response);
  }
}

// Check for active tasks before responding
async function checkActiveTasks(agent) {
  const tasks = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/tasks/next').then(r => r.json());
  const myTasks = tasks.filter(t => t.agent === agent);
  if (myTasks.length > 0) {
    console.log(`Active task found for ${agent}:`, myTasks[0].description);
    return myTasks[0];
  }
  return null;
}
```

### Context Preservation Rules
- Each agent maintains awareness of previous decisions in the workflow
- Always reference relevant context from earlier agents
- Include dependencies and assumptions in every response
- Maintain consistency with established architecture and requirements

### Quality Gates
Before any agent handoff:
1. ‚úÖ All required information provided in structured format
2. ‚úÖ Clear next steps and handoff context included
3. ‚úÖ Dependencies and assumptions explicitly stated
4. ‚úÖ Success criteria and acceptance criteria defined

## USAGE EXAMPLES

### Feature Development
```
@product-manager: We need user authentication with social login. Analyze market requirements and create user stories.

[Product Manager provides structured analysis]

@architect: Based on the requirements above, design a secure authentication system architecture.

[Architect provides technical design]

[QA provides bug analysis]

@backend-dev: Based on the QA analysis, investigate the OAuth implementation and identify the root cause.

[Continue with systematic debugging...]
```

### Performance Optimization  
```
@architect: Our API response times have increased to 2+ seconds. Analyze the system for bottlenecks.

[Architect provides performance analysis]

@backend-dev: Implement the database optimizations recommended by the architect.

[Continue with optimization implementation...]
