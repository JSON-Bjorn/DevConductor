> **The open-source solution that transforms any development environment into an enterprise-level AI-powered team with structured workflows, intelligent task delegation, and seamless handoffs between specialized AI agents.**

## 🚀 What DevConductor Solves

Stop juggling multiple AI tools and chaotic prompts. DevConductor orchestrates your entire development process through specialized AI agents that work together like a real development team:

- 🎯 **Product Manager Agent**: Requirements, user stories, feature prioritization
- 🏗️ **Architect Agent**: System design, technology decisions, scalability planning
- 🎨 **Frontend Dev Agent**: UI implementation, responsive design, accessibility
- ⚡ **Backend Dev Agent**: APIs, business logic, database design
- 🧪 **QA Agent**: Testing strategies, automation, quality assurance
- 🚀 **DevOps Agent**: Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment, monitoring
- 🔒 **Security Agent**: Threat modeling, compliance, vulnerability assessment

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎼 Intelligent Orchestration**: Agents automatically hand off tasks to the right specialist
- **📋 Structured Workflows**: Pre-built templates for feature development, MVP planning, bug fixes
- **🔧 Cursor Integration**: Works seamlessly with Cursor IDE through enhanced .cursorrules
- **📊 Real-time Dashboard**: Track progress across all agents and workflows
- **🆓 100% Free**: No paid APIs or external services required
- **🐳 One-Command Deploy**: Docker setup gets you running in 30 seconds

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Your favorite IDE (Cursor recommended)
- 5 minutes of your time ⏱️

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DevConductor.git
cd DevConductor

# Set up Python environment
python3.11 -m venv devconductor-env
source devconductor-env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# devconductor-env\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the orchestrator
python -m orchestrator.main
```

🎉 **That's it!** DevConductor is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

### Cursor IDE Integration

```bash
# Copy the enhanced .cursorrules to your project
cp cursor-integration/.cursorrules /path/to/your/project/

# Start using agents in Cursor
# @product-manager: What features should we prioritize for our MVP?
# @architect: Design the system architecture for a task management app
# @frontend-dev: Implement a responsive dashboard component
```

## 🎪 How It Works

### 1. Create a Workflow
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/workflows" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "new-feature",
    "description": "User authentication system with social login"
  }'
```

### 2. Let Agents Work Their Magic
Each agent automatically receives tasks in the right order:
1. **Product Manager** → Defines requirements and user stories
2. **Architect** →
